# **App Name**: EyeLearn

## Core Features:

- Dataset Upload: Upload a CSV dataset of eye movement data for training the Random Forest model.
- Model Training: Train a Random Forest model using the uploaded dataset to predict dyslexia based on eye movement patterns. The model should be optimized for accuracy. The AI tool will determine dyslexia probability based on learned patterns.
- Patient Data Input: Input new eye movement data for a patient to predict their likelihood of having dyslexia.
- Dyslexia Prediction Display: Display the prediction result (probability of dyslexia) along with a confidence level indicator. The AI tool will output the probability, and the UI will visualize it.
- User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for data input, model training, and prediction display.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3498db) to represent trust and intelligence.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent: Orange (#e67e22) to highlight important information and call-to-action buttons.
- Clear and readable font for data display and input fields.
- Simple and intuitive layout with clear sections for data upload, model training, and prediction.
- Subtle animations to indicate loading and processing states.
- Use simple, recognizable icons to represent data input, model training, and prediction results.

## Original User Request:
hi, Can ypu create the python machinelearning using random forest algorithm web app to predict dyslexia through eye movement, it should train the dataset which was given and after giving the patient dataset it should predict weather he has dyslexia or not, it should be more accurate than other machinelearning models.
